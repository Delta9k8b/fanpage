            Bio
        </h2>
            <p>
                The band Hippo Campus was formed in 2013 in St Paul, Minnesota. 
                They are considered to be a rock band by some folks' standards. Although it would
                depend on who you ask; some would consider them to be indie, indie-rock, indie-pop, or like mentioned, just rock.
                They don't fall into one genre, and their music tends to blur a lot of lines. 
                Their musical themes jump from place to place throughout their discogrophy. 
                Although when listening, you will get the impression that they start to really get a sense
                of direction for their sound with their first full length album "Landmark" in 2017.
